Process management or managing programs is one operating system function.  It has a running list of all the processes running at one time and chooses which process gets the processor when and for how long.  Once a process is done; it is removed from the running list.  This allows for multiple programs to be run simultaneously, assuming it is not a single task OS.
Operating systems provide a user with a User Interface.  The user interface is where the user can enter and receive information.  The operating system controls how the user can enter this info, through a graphical (GUI) or command line interface (CLI).
Managing memory is also a function of the operating system.  This is to adjust the use of the RAM and allot the needed amount as to best fit the needs of the data and instructions while they are being processed.  Once they are done being executed, they are removed to free up RAM for other instructions and data.
