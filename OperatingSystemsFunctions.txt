Process management or managing programs is one operating system function.  It has a running list of all the processes running at one time and chooses which process gets the processor when and for how long.  Once a process is done; it is removed from the running list.  This allows for multiple programs to be run simultaneously, assuming it is not a single task OS.
Operating systems provide a user with a User Interface.  The user interface is where the user can enter and receive information.  The operating system controls how the user can enter this info, through a graphical (GUI) or command line interface (CLI).
